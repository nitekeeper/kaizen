"""``KAIZEN_TRANSPORT`` selector — bridge (default) vs host (M8 strangler-fig).

M8 replaces kaizen's SQLite queue-bridge with atelier v1.10.0's deterministic
host engine via a strangler-fig migration. This module is the SINGLE place the
transport is resolved, so the wiring lands behind one flag:

  * ``bridge`` (DEFAULT, unset/empty/whitespace) — the existing SQLite
    queue-bridge dispatch. Byte-for-byte unchanged.
  * ``host`` — the in-process atelier host engine. The Phase-4 implementation-wave
    executor (:func:`scripts.host_executor.host_cycle_executor`) is wired +
    e2e-tested, and M8's glue PR connects it to the top-level ``kaizen:improve``
    flow at the SUBAGENT-SKILL layer: the Phase 1-3 meeting produces the
    Action-Items DAG in-prose, then :mod:`scripts.host_cycle_entry` hands that DAG
    to the executor. :func:`require_wired_transport` is therefore a SCOPED guard
    (``allow_host``): it resolves ``host`` cleanly for the wired
    ``scripts.host_cycle_entry`` path, but still raises :class:`NotImplementedError`
    for the run.py Python ``cycle_executor`` slot, which has no host branch + no
    DAG source (M8c / Option-B territory). It deliberately does NOT silently fall
    back to ``bridge`` — that would mask the flag.

Any other value raises :class:`UnknownTransportError` (fail-loud, mirroring
atelier's ``scripts.dispatch.resolve_transport``): a typo or a stale value in
someone's shell must surface loudly, not silently select the default.

The resolver lives in its own module (rather than in ``scripts/run.py``) so the
orchestrator's run/CRUD path is untouched until M8a-2 wires the host path — the
least-invasive seam for a foundation PR whose default behavior must be unchanged.

    THERE would silently route into a path that cannot produce ``action_items``
    (the M8c / Option-B territory the glue PR deliberately defers).

    So the guard is SCOPED, not global (RISK-4):

      * ``allow_host=False`` (DEFAULT) — the run.py Python-cycle-executor contract:
        ``host`` raises :class:`NotImplementedError`. Any FUTURE run.py caller that
        forgets the M8c factoring fails loud instead of half-wiring a broken run.
      * ``allow_host=True`` — the :mod:`scripts.host_cycle_entry` contract: ``host``
        resolves cleanly (the DAG was produced upstream and is handed in).

    ``bridge`` returns normally in both cases. Unknown values still raise
    :class:`UnknownTransportError` (via :func:`resolve_transport`). Centralizing the
    env semantics here keeps :data:`TRANSPORT_ENV_VAR` resolution in ONE place.
